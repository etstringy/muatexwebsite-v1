## Some stuff you might wanna know
- I tried making the Discord Tag update every time I changed it with javascript, thats why you can see a `muatex.js` file, if you wanna try fixing it for me  I'd appreciate it xd
- The `cave` folder is a portal for my Discord Server, where the rules and staff apps are, I kinda rushed this because the site was getting really delayed

## Resources
### Twemoji Awesome
I used [Twemoji Awesome](https://ellekasai.github.io/twemoji-awesome/) by [@ellekasai](https://github.com/ellekasai) to import Twemoji easily.

### Curator.io
[Curator](https://curator.io) is an app that can embed your Instagram feed. I used this so I didn't have to update this manually every time.
